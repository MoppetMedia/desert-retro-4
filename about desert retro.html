        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rae Canyon — a freelance designer, illustrator, traveller, and visual storyteller with a deep love for nostalgia and desert aesthetics. </p>
        <p>Growing up in the sun-scorched deserts of the American Southwest, I developed a love for the raw beauty of nature from an early age. My childhood was spent wandering desert trails, sketching the rugged landscape, and observing the unique light and colors of the arid world. These experiences would later shape my distinctive style, a blend of nostalgia, warmth, and the timeless desert aesthetic.</p>
        
<p>At the University of Arizona, I majored in Graphic Design with a minor in Art History. The intersection of visual storytelling and the power of design was something that spoke to me on a deeply personal level. My time at the university also sparked my fascination with vintage aesthetics, as I became drawn to old advertising, posters, and illustration styles from the early 20th century. This interest would later influence the retro elements woven throughout my work, particularly in my illustrations and branding projects.

While at the University of Arizona, I also spent a year abroad in Merzouga, Morocco, where I immersed myself in the country's vibrant art and design scene. The Maghreb influences, mixed with my Southwestern roots, gave me a unique artistic perspective that I would carry with me throughout her career.</p>

<p>Since graduating, I began my freelance career. Initially focused on graphic design, I worked with local businesses, developing logos, branding materials, and marketing campaigns. As my skills grew, I expanded into illustration and photography. My work has begun to garner attention for its earthy, vintage-inspired style and its ability to evoke the nostalgia and beauty of the desert.</p>

<p>The acrylic paintings of desert landscapes, alongside my sketches of desert-dwelling people, have become beloved parts of my portfolio. Whether working on branding for local artisans or capturing the essence of desert life in photography, my love for the desert always shines through. But I still frequently travel throughout the Southwest, visiting places like Monument Valley, Joshua Tree, and the Saguaro National Park, to photograph landscapes that would inspire my next series of work.

With each new project, I remain committed to telling stories that reflect my love for the desert and its people, blending nostalgia with modern design.</p>
